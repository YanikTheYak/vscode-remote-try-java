# Solve 3 Problems in Code Spaces : Java

   **Crane Stacks - level out the stacks**
   
   **FizzBuzz - the traditional coding challenge**
   
   **Palendrome - the traditional palendrome problem**
   

This is a problem to solve in Java, but it uses **[VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)** extension.

## Setting up the development container

Follow these steps to open a development container:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, you will need to setup Visual Studio Codespaces first....

2. Log into **[Visual Studio Codespaces](https://online.visualstudio.com/environments)**

3. Press the button on the right **"Create Codespace"**

4. Add a Codespace Name. Choose what you like!

5. Use this git repo as the repository.
   **https://github.com/YanikTheYak/vscode-remote-try-java-interview**
   
6. Choose your machine size:
   Basic (Linux): 2 Cores, 4 GB RAM is fine
   
7. Press **Create**

You should get a VS Code configured environment (either in your browser, or in your local VS Code install).
Now you can start solving the problem.

Some things to try:

1. **Edit:**
   - Open `src/main/java/com/erwin/interview/craneStacks.java`.
   - The problem is in the main comment.
   - Try adding some code and run the tests.
2. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `uname` and other Linux commands from the terminal window.
   - e.g. **mvn clean test**  to run all the test cases.
3. **Run a Test:**
   - Open `src/test/java/com/erwin/interview/craneStacksTest.java`.
   - Put a breakpoint in a test.
   - Click the `Debug Test` in the Code Lens above the function and watch it hit the breakpoint.
   - NB: This only works if you not Live Sharing
